# hello-world
Im a college student in the USA and ive been coding since i was a sophomore in high school starting on HTML. i havent really committed fully to coding and programming,
but Im gonna code more often now. i think coding is cool so im going to make a habit of it. I have experience in C++ and I've been meaning to dust off the cobwebs on Java and Python.

Update:
I have experience in C++, C, and R now. Starting some SQL, Python, and Java this semester.

P.S.
If you're a recruiter, a lot of my projects from classes are privated.
