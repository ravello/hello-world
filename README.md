# hello-world
(September 2020) (Soph)
Im a college student in the USA and ive been coding since i was a sophomore in high school starting on HTML. I have experience in C++ and I've been meaning to dust off the cobwebs on Java and Python.
I'm a 1st semester sophomore right now. And will be starting my CS core coursework next semester.

Update (May 2022) (Junior):
I have experience in C++, C, and R now. Java (w/ JavaFX), Python, F#, and looking at assembly too. 
I also finished programming the (very expensive) NAO robot for the research study I'm assisting using software called Choregraphe (part of the NAO software suite).
Starting some SQL, Python, and Java next semester.

Update (January 2023) (Senior):
I finished the fall semester and have experience with hardware, Arduino, and the C++ for Arduino. Completed the final project.
I got through the systems programming course (w/ a hard prof) with more programming in C and the terminal.
I finished my algorithms course. There was little programming but a lot of theory. The prof was very nice.
I completed a elective class that focused on database systems and used MySQL as well as the Google Cloud Platform. I deployed a database project to the cloud.

Update (May 2023) (Just graduated!):
I have more experience in Python for Data science using libraries like pandas, Java for object oriented programming, and HTML/CSS. 
I have new experience in JavaScript and the React framework.
I jumped in the deep end with the unity project and figured a lot of things myself and (unfortunately) had to make most of the project myself.
I graduated college!! 

P.S.
I have a lot of privated projects since theyre from my courses.
