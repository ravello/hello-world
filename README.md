# hello-world
Im ravello. im a college student in the USA and ive been coding since i was a sophomore in high school starting on HTML. i havent really committed fully to coding and programming,
but that changes now! i think coding is cool so im going to make a habit of it. I have experience in C++ and I've been meaning to dust off the cobwebs on Java and Python.
I'm making changes to this file. This is a test.
