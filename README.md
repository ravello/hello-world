# hello-world
Im a college student in the USA and ive been coding since i was a sophomore in high school starting on HTML. I have experience in C++ and I've been meaning to dust off the cobwebs on Java and Python.

Update:
I have experience in C++, C, and R now. Starting some SQL, Python, and Java this semester.

P.S.
I have a lot of privated projects since theyre from my courses.
